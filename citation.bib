  abstract   = {The Internet and computer networks are exposed to an increasing number of security threats. With new types of attacks appearing continually, developing flexible and adaptive security oriented approaches is a severe challenge. In this context, anomaly-based network intrusion detection techniques are a valuable technology to protect target systems and networks against malicious activities. However, despite the variety of such methods described in the literature in recent years, security tools incorporating anomaly detection functionalities are just starting to appear, and several important problems remain to be solved. This paper begins with a review of the most well-known anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques. Then, available platforms, systems under development and research projects in the area are presented. Finally, we outline the main challenges to be dealt with for the wide scale deployment of anomaly-based intrusion detectors, with special emphasis on assessment issues.},
